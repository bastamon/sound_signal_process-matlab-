function f=enframe(x,win,inc)
%ENFRAME split signal up into (overlapping) frames: one per row. F=(X,WIN,INC)
%
%	F = ENFRAME(X,LEN) splits the vector X up into
%	frames. Each frame is of length LEN and occupies
%	one row of the output matrix. The last few frames of X
%	will be ignored if its length is not divisible by LEN.
%	It is an error if X is shorter than LEN.
%
%	F = ENFRAME(X,LEN,INC) has frames beginning at increments of INC
%	The centre of frame I is X((I-1)*INC+(LEN+1)/2) for I=1,2,...
%	The number of frames is fix((length(X)-LEN+INC)/INC)
%
%	F = ENFRAME(X,WINDOW) or ENFRAME(X,WINDOW,INC) multiplies
%	each frame by WINDOW(:)
